/**
 * Curated scene names.
 *
 * ## Why a table at all
 *
 * The default rule - the match-weighted modal city label of a scene's venues -
 * is right often enough to be the default and wrong often enough to need this.
 * It fails in one predictable direction: it names a *region* after whichever
 * single municipality happens to hold the busiest store. "Milpitas CA" is a
 * true statement about where the most matches were played and a useless answer
 * to "which scene is this", because the eight stores around it are in San Jose,
 * Santa Clara and Sunnyvale and nobody calls that Milpitas. The same for
 * "Valley Stream NY" where a local would say Nassau County, and "Woluwe-Saint-
 * Lambert" where they would say Brussels.
 *
 * So geography supplies the default and judgement supplies the exceptions. That
 * is the shape `scraper/CLAUDE.md` recommends - "Geography as the label,
 * inference as the definition" - and the exceptions have to live somewhere a
 * human can read and edit, which is here rather than in a database row.
 *
 * ## Why the key is a shop id
 *
 * An override needs to survive the thing it is attached to being re-clustered.
 * Three candidate keys, and only one of them does:
 *
 * - **A scene id** is carried forward by venue-set Jaccard overlap, so it is
 *   stable *most* of the time and silently is not when a scene splits or
 *   merges. An override keyed on it would stop applying exactly when the map
 *   changed, which is the moment it is most needed.
 * - **A city label** is the thing being corrected. Keying the correction on it
 *   is circular, and it moves when reverse geocoding improves.
 * - **A `shopExternalId`** is a durable identity that outlives seasons, and it
 *   is already the only thing a scene is allowed to be keyed on anywhere in
 *   this pass (see `scenes.ts` on `venueKey`'s `geo:` fallback). A store does
 *   not move.
 *
 * So an override names a **store**, and the scene containing that store takes
 * the name. The store chosen is the scene's busiest, because that is the one
 * least likely to drop out of the scene it anchors.
 *
 * ## The rules this table follows
 *
 * - **An override applies to at most one scene per run.** Two overrides landing
 *   in one scene would be ambiguous, so the match is decided by the scene's
 *   busiest overridden store and the rest are ignored - deterministically, on
 *   matches then on shop id.
 * - **A name is a place a player would recognise**, at the scale the clustering
 *   actually produces. With a 30km diameter cap that is often a district or a
 *   county rather than a metro: "Peninsula" and "South Bay" rather than "SF Bay
 *   Area", which at this bound is four or five separate scenes and naming any
 *   one of them after the whole region would be the same error in the other
 *   direction.
 * - **An unrecognised store is not an error.** A store that ages out of the
 *   replay window takes its override out of use and nothing breaks; the scene
 *   falls back to its modal city label.

 * so a later reader can tell whether the override is still earning its place -
